# Information assets

Every asset the [ISMS](isms.md) protects, its classification and its owner.
The owner of every asset is Webber; a column for it would say nothing.

## Classification

| Class            | Meaning                                                                | Handling                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**       | Meant for anyone: the source, the specs, the marketing and help sites. | No restriction; integrity still matters.                      |
| **Internal**     | Operational detail that helps an attacker: logs, configs, records.     | Kept out of the public repository; shared on need.            |
| **Confidential** | What people put in LiveDoc and who they are.                           | Reached only through the api's access checks; never logged.   |
| **Secret**       | Keys that grant access.                                                | Only in a secret store; never displayed, logged or committed. |

A document's content is Confidential even when it sits behind a share link: the link is a key, not a publication.
Labels are not stamped on data; the class follows from the store it lives in, as listed below.

## Data stores

## Secrets

The full list and rotation rules live in the [Secrets policy](../002-project-scope/secrets-policy.md).

## Operator accounts

Each can change production, its code or its name, so each is a way in.

## Suppliers

The processors the [Privacy Policy](../../../apps/help/app/policies/privacy-policy/page.mdx) names, plus the tooling suppliers.
[Review suppliers](../../instructions/review-suppliers.md) keeps their evidence.
