# Statement of Applicability

Every control in Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2022, whether it applies to the [ISMS](isms.md), and how it is met.

## Statuses

- **Implemented** - in place, with the evidence named.
- **Partial** - in place in part; the gap is named and tracked by a risk in the [risk register](risk-register.md).
- **Planned** - applicable, not yet in place.
- **To confirm** - in place by intent; its evidence is first produced by the next review that checks it.
- **Excluded** - not applicable, with the reason.
