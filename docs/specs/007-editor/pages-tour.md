# Pages tour ("Start Pages Tour")

A short, optional guided tour of one [page kind](pages-mode.md#page-kinds) in Pages mode: a slide, an
infographic, an article or a logo. Like every tour it is started from the bottom bar's **Start Pages Tour** button
and never offers itself; [Show Me](show-me.md) runs the same track from a page's panel. Each kind has its own
**track**, which shows how that kind of page is made by opening the real controls on the person's own page (a
slide's Layout and Background popovers, its deck button, the Slide Deck and Present) rather than only pointing at
them. It is the [Draw tour](../023-draw-mode/draw-tour.md)'s sibling: the same Start Tour button, anchored step
cards, glide, dimming ring, Skip, Back and closing card, driven by the same engine. Where this spec is silent, the
Draw tour's rules hold.

## Where it appears

The bottom bar's Start Tour button is the one way in, for this tour as for every other; the [Diagram
tour](editor-tour.md) "Where it appears" describes the button, which tour it offers when several could run, and the
closing card. This tour's part:

- **On the button as "Start Pages Tour"**, whatever the page kind, while the open tab is in Pages, to an Editor,
  once the editor is usable (hydrated, no welcome overlay, not read-only, not an embed), the tab is not locked and
  at least one of its pages has its kind chosen. The selected element's own tour ([Element tours](element-tours.md),
  for a kind opted in to) takes the button while that element is selected. A tour never starts, prompts or offers
  itself: until 28 October 2026 each kind offered itself once ("Getting started with ...?", No / Yes) after a short
  delay.
- **Not over Start Making Pages**, nor over the first page's own kind choice ("What Is This Page For?"): the button
  waits until a template is picked or the panel closed ([Start Diagramming](start-diagramming.md) "The tours
  wait"), or the page's kind is chosen.
- **A press starts the first step** of the tour page's track; there is no welcome card. A press while another tour
  is on screen does nothing ("One tour at a time").
- **The tour page** is picked at the press: of the pages on screen, unlocked and showing their title bar, the one
  showing the most of itself in the window, a page of a kind not yet taken first; its kind picks the track. With
  no such page on screen a press does nothing.
- **It stays on offer once taken.** Finishing or skipping a track does not take the button away: pressing it again
  runs it again.
- **Taken, on every device.** However a run ends (completed or skipped), the synced `pagesTourKinds` user
  preference ([User preferences](user-preferences.md)) records its kind. The record feeds the Settings rows and
  which page a press prefers; it no longer hides the button. `pagesTourSeen` true counts every kind as taken only
  while [Power user mode](power-user-mode.md) is on (`apps/live/lib/tour-tracks.ts`, shared with the [Plan
  tour](../026-plan/plan-tour.md)).
- **Rerun from Settings**: in Settings' **Tours** category, **Pages Tours** switches every kind at once (on while
  any is untaken; off marks them all taken, on forgets every record), and one switch per kind sits nested beneath
  it, named for its kind (**Slides Tour**, **Infographic Tour**, **Article Tour**, **Logo Tour**). On means that
  kind has not been taken. Turning one off marks that kind alone; turning one on forgets that kind alone (and folds
  a Power user's single `pagesTourSeen` into the taken list first, so the other kinds stay as they were). Closing
  Settings with a kind newly on starts the tour when it is on offer right now; otherwise it does nothing, and the
  button is there when the person is in Pages. Power user mode's readout lists **Pages Tours**.
- **Replayable from the page**: every page's panel carries **Show Me**, which runs that page's track on demand
  ([Show Me](show-me.md)).

## Tour content

The tour opens popovers, the page's panel and the Slide Deck, and closes them again on leaving the step. Its
controls stay live: a layout or background the person picks while its step is up is theirs, kept as any pick is (one
edit, undoable). The Logo track alone places something: two shapes to combine (below), placed, united and taken away
with no undo step (`useTourSquare`), so the page is left as it was and Undo never brings them back.

## The steps

The track's steps, then its closing card, a step card in the same popover (`TourPopover`) that sits outside the
step count. Each
step rings one control of the tour page (or the Slide Deck), held by its own page rather than the first page's,
never the whole page: a ring that size would light most of the screen, so a step about the page itself is a card
on its own (centred, counted, no ring), and a popover step rings its title-bar button until the popover shows.

Each track's cards name its page kind, never the mode: eyebrow **Slides tour**, **Infographic tour**, **Article
tour** or **Logo tour**. The exact strings live in `apps/live/components/tour/<kind>-tour-steps.ts`.

**A step that opens a popover** (Layout, Background, the Slide Deck) opens it once on entering, by pressing its
real button, and rings it. The popover stays open while the person presses the tour's card. Picking from it closes
it as it always does: the ring then moves to the tour page, so the person sees what they picked land; the step
never reopens it. Leaving the step closes whatever it opened that is still open.

**A step that opens the page's panel** opens it on the tab it is about (Page, Style, Text, or a logo page's
Layouts) and closes it on leaving.

### Slides track

1. **Choose a Layout** (the slide's Layout popover, opened): hover a layout to preview it, press to place it;
   Change Theme restyles every page.
2. **Change the Background** (the Background popover, opened): colours, gradients, animated backgrounds and
   pictures, a pattern on top; hover to preview, press to keep it.
3. **Add Another Slide** (the + after the last page, or the Toolbar strip's + while that one is out of the window).
4. **Your Slide Deck** (the Slide Deck, opened from the Slides button, ringing its rows): every slide page is in the
   deck already; drag a row to reorder, press one to go to that slide.
5. **Each Slide's Menu** (a row's ⋯ menu, opened): speaker notes, hide from the show, rename, duplicate.
6. **Set Up the Show** (the deck's Presentation settings, opened): transitions and their speed, auto-advance, slide
   size.
7. **Present** (the deck's Present button): full screen, arrow keys to move, Escape to end.
8. **You're ready to present** (closing card).

The deck stays open from step 4 to step 7 and closes after them, however the tour leaves them
(`holdSlideDeck` / `releaseSlideDeck`).

### Infographic track

1. **Your Page** (the page's name): press it to fit the page to the screen, drag it to reorder.
2. **Start From a Layout** (the Layout popover, opened).
3. **Change the Background** (the Background popover, opened).
4. **Page Size** (the page's panel, opened on Page): size and orientation; duplicate, move or delete below.
5. **Add a Page** (the +).
6. **Present It** (the Slide Deck, opened): any page can be a slide, picked in the deck and presented.
7. **You're ready to make pages** (closing card).

A **wireframe** page takes this track, save step 4,
**Device**: its cog picks the device, turns it and sets its frame, rather than a page size.

### Article track

1. **Write on the Page** (a centred card, no ring): click to write, `/` for blocks; full pages flow onto the next.
2. **The Page Toolbar** (the article's page toolbar, held up on the tour page through the step: it otherwise shows
   only while a page is hovered or written on).
3. **Article Style** (the Style popover beside the cog, opened by its button, [Article pages](article-pages.md) "Article style"): looks, accent, margins, page numbers, for every page of
   the article.
4. **Fonts and Spacing** (the Text popover beside it).
5. **You're ready to write** (closing card).

### Logo track

The logo page's Show Me steps ([Logo pages](logo-pages.md#show-me)): **Start From a Logo Layout** (the panel, opened on Layouts), **Draw on Guides** and **Mirror As You Draw**
(each popover opened), then Combine shown for real (`logo-combine-demo.ts`): **Combine Shapes** places a square and
a circle overlapping in the page's lower third and selects them, so Combine shows; **Four Ways to Combine** opens its
menu; **One Shape** unites them, as Unite does, and highlights the result. Then **That Is a Logo Page**. The shapes and
their union go when the tour ends.

### Filtering

- A step whose control is not on screen when the tour starts (a slide's deck button and the Slides button on a
  phone; the + when neither the one after the last page nor the Toolbar strip's is in the window) is left out up front, so the count stays honest; one that goes before its
  turn is skipped, as in the Diagram tour.
- If the tour can no longer run where it started (the person's edit rights go, they leave Pages, they open
  another tab, or the tour page is deleted or locked) it ends as skipped, closing whatever it opened.

## Share roles

Only someone who may edit the tab sees Start Pages Tour, or Show Me: an **Editor**. A **Participant** or a
**Viewer** never does, since the page controls it opens are not theirs to use.

## Telemetry ([Telemetry](../017-telemetry/telemetry.md))

The Draw tour's funnel, with its own tokens; the track shows in the step tokens:

- **Offer**: `UI` · `Opened` · `PagesTourOffer` the first time the Start Tour button shows this tour in a page load.
  Until 28 October 2026 it counted the welcome card showing, and `UI` · `Closed` · `PagesTourOffer` counted **No**;
  nothing sends Closed now.
- **Start**: `UI` · `Started` · `PagesTour` on a press of the button (or the Settings rerun).
- **Stage views**: `UI` · `View` · `PagesTourStep<Kind><Id>` once per step entry, `<Kind>` the track
  (`Slide`, `Infographic`, `Article`, `Logo`): `PagesTourStepSlideLayouts`,
  `PagesTourStepInfographicPageSize`, `PagesTourStepArticleStyle`, `PagesTourStepLogoOutro`, ...
- **End**: `UI` · `Ended` · `PagesTourCompleted` | `PagesTourSkipped`.
- **Settings rows**: `UI` · `Toggled` · `<Kind>TourSeenOn` | `<Kind>TourSeenOff`, for `SlidesTour`,
  `InfographicTour`, `ArticleTour` and `LogoTour` (`PagesTourSeenOn` | `PagesTourSeenOff` until the row split
  per kind in October 2026).
- **Page Show Me**: `UI` · `Started` · `<Kind>Tour`, and `UI` · `Ended` · `<Kind>TourCompleted` |
  `<Kind>TourSkipped`, for `SlideTour`, `InfographicTour`, `ArticleTour` and `LogoTour` ([Show Me](show-me.md)).

## Power user mode

[Power user mode](power-user-mode.md) marks the Pages tour seen (`pagesTourSeen`, every kind while the mode
is on) alongside the Diagram, Plan, Workshop and Draw tours.

## Code

- `<kind>-tour-steps.ts` (`slide-`, `infographic-`, `article-`, `logo-`): each track's steps, against one
  `PageTourApi` (`page-tour-api.ts`); `page-tour-dom.ts` opens and closes a page's title-bar popovers and finds
  its controls; `page-tour-steps.ts` picks a track's steps for a kind, loaded at the press so the
  copy stays out of the editor's first load.
- `PagesTourHost.tsx`: when the tour is on the Start Tour button, the tour page and the taken record. `PageTour.tsx`: the page panel's Show Me.
- `apps/live/lib/page-panel-request.ts`: how a tour opens or closes a page's panel on a tab from outside `CanvasPages`.
