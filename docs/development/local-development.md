# Local development

How to run livediagram on your machine.

## Requirements

- **Node** `>= 22` (Wrangler 4 requires it).
- **pnpm** `>= 9` (the lockfile and workspaces depend on it).

Cloudflare is not required for local development. The api worker runs locally via Wrangler against a local D1 SQLite file; the Next.js apps run via Next's dev server.

## Clone and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/livediagram-app/livediagram.app livediagram
cd livediagram
pnpm install
```

This installs every workspace at once, including TypeScript 7 ([Contributing](contributing.md#typescript)).

## Apply the local database migrations (once, before first `pnpm dev`)

`wrangler dev` does NOT auto-apply migrations: a fresh local D1 starts empty. Run this once after cloning, and again whenever a new migration lands under `apps/api/migrations/`:

```sh
pnpm --filter @livedoc/api db:migrate:local
```

It applies every SQL file in `apps/api/migrations/` to the local SQLite file Wrangler keeps at `apps/api/.wrangler/state/v3/d1/`. The production deploy runs the equivalent `db:migrate:remote` step automatically in CI (see [Self-hosting](../operations/self-hosting.md)).

## Run everything

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Turbo spins up all eight dev servers in parallel:

| App              | Dev URL                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/router`    | `http://localhost:4000` — **everything on one port**, stitched like production                     |
| `apps/marketing` | `http://localhost:4001`                                                                            |
| `apps/live`      | `http://localhost:4002` (clean routes: /new, /explorer, ...)                                       |
| `apps/telemetry` | `http://localhost:4003/telemetry`                                                                  |
| `apps/help`      | `http://localhost:4004/help`                                                                       |
| `apps/community` | `http://localhost:4005/community`                                                                  |
| `apps/api`       | `http://localhost:8787/api`                                                                        |
| `apps/mcp`       | `http://localhost:8788` (MCP server, [MCP server](../specs/015-api/mcp-server.md); signed-in only) |

The `router` dev server (`wrangler dev --env local`, port 4000) gives you the production URL shape locally: `/` is marketing, `/new` and `/document/*` are the editor, plus `/telemetry`, `/help`, `/community`, and `/api` — no per-app port to remember. It has no service bindings in dev; the `[env.local]` environment in `apps/router/wrangler.toml` points it at the localhost origins above and it proxies plain HTTP (see [Router app](../specs/016-platform/router-app.md)).

**Use port 4000 unless you have a reason not to.** Each app's own port still serves its pages, but only the router puts the API on the same origin. The frontends call `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, defaulting to the relative `/api` — correct in production and behind the router, and a dead end on an app's own port, where nothing serves `/api` (these are static exports; there are no Next API routes, see [Architecture](architecture.md)). So the editor on `http://localhost:4002` cannot reach the api worker until you tell it where the worker is:

```sh
# apps/live/.env.local  (gitignored; see apps/live/.env.example)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8787/api
```

A remote api works too: a pull request's preview api (the address in its preview comment,
followed by `/api`) has its own database and is the one to reach for; the production api reads
and writes real people's documents ([Preview deployments](../specs/016-platform/preview-deployments.md)).

Without it the editor loads, the canvas works, and the first save fails with **“Couldn’t create the document”** — which reads like a broken api worker rather than a missing variable, so it is worth setting up front. `apps/telemetry`, `apps/help` and `apps/community` read the same variable: the dashboard needs it to show anything on `:4003`, the Community needs it to list any posts on `:4005`, and the help centre only loses its telemetry posts without it. To work on the dashboard against real numbers without seeding a local database, point it at production's summary instead: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://www.livediagram.app/api` in `apps/telemetry/.env.local`. `GET /api/telemetry/summary` is public, read-only and allows any origin, and the dashboard only sends events itself when `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`, which local builds leave unset.

The editor works in pure-guest mode without any auth setup: `pnpm dev` and open `http://localhost:4000/new`. Documents persist to the local D1 file the api worker creates on first start. (On `http://localhost:4002/new` instead, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` first — see the note above.)

## Scoping commands to one workspace

```sh
pnpm --filter @livedoc/live dev
pnpm --filter @livedoc/api test
pnpm --filter @livedoc/marketing build
```

Workspace names follow the pattern `@livedoc/<app-or-package-folder-name>`.

Turbo caches results, so re-running with no changes is a no-op.

## Signing in locally (optional)

The editor works without sign-in. To exercise the signed-in code paths, turn it on in the api worker; the frontends
ask the api at runtime, so nothing changes in their env files:

```sh
# apps/api/.dev.vars (gitignored)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 32>
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
# Email codes without a mailbox: each code lands in the outbox instead of being sent.
EMAIL_OUTBOX=1
```

Restart `pnpm dev` and sign in **through the router on port 4000** (`http://localhost:4000/sign-in`): the session
cookie belongs to the api, so the page and the api must share an origin, which only the router gives you locally. Type
any email, choose **Send code**, and follow the code step's **This preview sends no email: see the code** link (or open
`http://localhost:4000/api/preview/outbox?to=<email>`): the subject starts with the 6-digit code. The first code for
an address creates its account.

To add **Continue with Google**, create a Google OAuth client (web application) with
`http://localhost:4000/api/auth/callback/google` as an authorised redirect URI and `http://localhost:4000` as a
JavaScript origin, and add `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` to `apps/api/.dev.vars`.

Without `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (or with it but no sign-in method), `/api/auth/*` answers 404, the auth pages say sign-in
isn't turned on for this site, and every request is a guest (the `X-Owner-Id` header path). This is the self-host
default. See [Auth + guest access](../specs/014-identity/auth-and-guest-access.md) for the full hybrid model.

## Running the CLI from source (optional)

The [CLI](../specs/015-api/cli.md) acts only with an API token, so it needs a host with sign-in: turn it on as
above, sign in, and create a token in Settings › API Tokens. Then build the bundle and point it at the local api:

```bash
pnpm --filter @livedoc/cli build
export LIVEDOC_HOST=http://localhost:8787 LIVEDOC_TOKEN=lvd_...
apps/cli/dist/livedoc.mjs document ls
```

`LIVEDOC_DEBUG=1` prints each decision and request as a `[cli]` line on stderr. The CLI keeps its files under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/livedoc` and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/livedoc` (`~/.config` and `~/.cache` by default); point
both at a scratch directory to keep a test run apart from your own sign-in.

## Enabling AI assistance locally (optional)

The AI panel ([AI Assistance](../specs/007-editor/ai-assistance.md)) is hidden entirely unless the api worker has a model key. To turn it on locally:

```sh
# apps/api/.dev.vars (gitignored). One key serves every AI feature.
OPENAI_API_KEY=...             # or GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY=..., or both:
#                              # the assistant then runs on OpenAI, the reader on Google
# AI_API_KEY=...               # any other OpenAI-compatible provider, used only when
# AI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1  # neither named key is set; needs both of these
# AI_MODEL=gpt-4o              # the assistant's model; optional for the named keys
# AI_VISION_MODEL=...          # optional; reads sticky crops (docs/specs/021-event-storming/event-storming.md).
#                              # On Google this defaults to gemini-2.5-flash-lite,
#                              # which reads handwriting better than the big model.
```

Restart `pnpm dev`. `GET /api/capabilities` will start reporting `{ aiEnabled: true }`, the Settings dialog grows an "AI Assistant" toggle, and the editor surfaces the panel once the user opts in. The two spend-DoS knobs `AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `AI_REQUIRE_ACCOUNT` are hosted-only; leave them unset locally so the guest path keeps working. Production declares `AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `apps/api/wrangler.toml` `[vars]`, which `wrangler dev` also reads, so the api's `dev` script (and the e2e stack) blank it with `--var AI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS:`; without that, every AI request from a localhost editor answers 403 `origin_not_allowed`. See `apps/api/.env.example` for the full set of vars the worker reads.

## Running tests

```sh
pnpm test                                # everything
pnpm --filter @livedoc/api test      # one workspace
pnpm --filter @livedoc/live exec vitest   # watch mode while developing
```

Tests live alongside the code they cover, as `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` files. The test runner is [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) with the shared config from `@livedoc/vitest-config`. See [Testing](../specs/003-system-architecture/testing.md) for the testing contract.

The Google Drive mirror has an opt-in end-to-end run against the fake Google ([Google Drive mirror](../specs/022-drive-mirror/drive-mirror.md)): `pnpm --filter @livedoc/live test:e2e:drive`. It rebuilds `apps/live/out` with a test Google client id and Picker key, then boots the e2e stack on its own ports (live 3023, api 8792, marketing 3024) with sign-in on and `E2E_DRIVE=1`, which gives the api worker test values for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DRIVE_TOKEN_KEY` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_BASE_URL`. Each test account signs in for real (an email code from the stack's outbox), and the test serves the fake Google (8796) itself. Rebuild the live app normally before running the ordinary e2e again.

`pnpm --filter @livedoc/live test:e2e:drive-shots` uses the same build and stack to screenshot every Drive state (Settings > Account > Cloud Sync in every phase, Open with, the Explorer following a change made in Drive) in light and dark at 1280 x 800 (`E2E_DRIVE_SHOTS_SCALE=2` for 2x, `E2E_DRIVE_SHOTS_NARROW=1` for the phone layout), into `E2E_DRIVE_PR_SHOTS` (default `/tmp/ld-drive-pr-shots`) with a `README.md` naming each file. Run it on its own: it serves the same fake Google port as `test:e2e:drive`.

Workbench embeds have an opt-in end-to-end run ([Workbench embeds](../specs/013-workspace/workbench-embeds.md)): `pnpm --filter @livedoc/live test:e2e:workbench`, against the usual `apps/live/out`. It boots the e2e stack on its own ports (live 3021, api 8791, marketing 3022) with sign-in on, whose `APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3021` points the workbench and pairing URLs at the live server; the person signs in for real with an email code from the stack's outbox. The spec serves a fake workbench (`apps/live/e2e/fixtures/fake-workbench.html`) from `127.0.0.1` on a free port, pairs it on the pairing page, and frames `/embed/workbench` in it; `workbench-workspace.spec.ts` pairs it again for the whole workspace and frames `/embed/workbench/explorer`, whose places (`/embed/workbench/explorer/**`, `/embed/workbench/document/**`) the stack serves from that one page, as the live worker does.

## Enabling the Google Drive mirror locally (optional)

The mirror needs a Google Cloud OAuth client (web application) with `http://localhost:4000/drive/connected` as an authorised redirect URI and `http://localhost:4000` as a JavaScript origin, and the Drive API enabled:

```sh
# apps/api/.dev.vars (gitignored)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789012-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
DRIVE_TOKEN_KEY=...        # openssl rand -base64 32

# apps/live/.env.local (gitignored)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123456789012-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=... # optional: the Picker's browser key, for adopting a folder
```

It is signed-in only, so sign-in must be on too (above). Without these Settings has no Cloud Sync section and every `/api/drive` route answers `503 drive_not_configured`.

## Trying the photo import without an AI key

The e2e stack (`scripts/e2e-stack.mjs`) can serve the built editor a second
time, beside a running stack, as a deployment WITHOUT an AI key runs it — so
the photo import reads the handwriting with the in-browser model (and shows
its download the first time):

```bash
E2E_LIVE_PORT=3402 E2E_API_PORT=8887 E2E_LIVE_ONLY=1 E2E_NO_AI=1 node scripts/e2e-stack.mjs
```

`E2E_LIVE_ONLY=1` serves the static editor only, proxying to the api already
on `E2E_API_PORT`; `E2E_NO_AI=1` answers `/api/capabilities` with
`aiEnabled: false`.

`E2E_SIGN_IN=1` turns sign-in on, as the signed-in runs boot it: email codes are the one method and land in
the outbox (`GET /api/preview/outbox?to=<email>`), and the live origin is sign-in's base URL. Without it the stack
is guest-only, whatever `apps/api/.dev.vars` says ([End-to-end tests](../specs/003-system-architecture/e2e-smoke.md)).

To try a hosted reader whose free budget is spent, swap `E2E_NO_AI=1` for
`E2E_AI_BUDGET_SPENT=1`: the api still reports a model, every
`/api/ai/read-notes` call answers 429 `ai_quota`, and the import fails over
to the in-browser model and says so ([Event storming](../specs/021-event-storming/event-storming.md) Phase 9).

## Four gotchas

- **All five Next.js dev servers (`marketing`, `live`, `telemetry`, `help`, `community`) run through `scripts/next-dev.mjs`.** It frees the port and points dev at an isolated `.next-dev/` cache, so a `next build` running in the same checkout can't corrupt the dev server (the recurring "unstyled help page" / `Cannot find module './NNNN.js'` failures). The cache is kept between starts: Turbopack's file-system cache reuses the last session's compilation (a warm start serves its first page in about a second) and reconciles a route restructure by itself, and `turbopackGc` keeps it from growing stale ([Next.js](../specs/016-platform/nextjs.md) "The Turbopack cache"). A cache that goes wrong is a bug to fix, not something to wipe away. All five run on Turbopack, which is also what `next build` uses under Next 16, so dev compiles the same way the deployed bundle does. Every app's settings come from `@livedoc/next-config` (`livedocNextConfig`), so a change to them lands in all five at once.

  `help` was pinned to webpack until the Next 16 upgrade, because Turbopack's Rust MDX pipeline ignores remark/rehype plugins handed over as imported JS functions and its pipe tables rendered as literal text. `apps/help/next.config.ts` now names `remark-gfm` as a string (`remarkPlugins: [['remark-gfm', {}]]`), which Turbopack resolves itself, so the tables survive. Keep that string form: importing the plugin back fails the build outright under Turbopack with "does not have serializable options".

  Next 16 also writes `next-env.d.ts` into whichever app you run it from, gitignored on purpose: it names the active distDir inside itself, so dev and build would otherwise rewrite it over each other, and each app's tsconfig already picks up the Next types without it being tracked. Next can also generate an `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` pair of agent instructions; the shared config turns that off (`agentRules: false`), because the repo's agent instructions are written by hand in the root `AGENTS.md`. Any old generated pair left in an app folder stays gitignored and can be deleted.

  The webpack escape hatch is still there — `pnpm --filter @livedoc/live dev:webpack` boots the editor on webpack, and `scripts/next-dev.mjs` honours `--webpack` from any app. It exists for the case where Turbopack genuinely doesn't support something the app needs, and it is a diagnostic rather than a default: Turbopack became the default precisely because webpack's HMR kept desynchronising here and serving `__webpack_modules__[moduleId] is not a function` until someone wiped `.next`. If you find yourself needing the hatch, that is worth a spec note rather than a habit. The editor on webpack also runs without the React Compiler, whose native Rust port is Turbopack-only ([React state and effects](../specs/003-system-architecture/react-state-and-effects.md)), so a render bug seen only on one bundler may be the compiler.

- **`/licences` needs its generated data.** `pnpm dev` does not run the generator (it takes about 20 seconds), so the marketing dev server fails that one page with `LicencesManifestMissing` until you run `pnpm licences` once. Don't run `pnpm licences` while a `next build` of the editor, help centre or telemetry dashboard is running: Next's analyzer shares an app's Turbopack build cache (`.next/cache`), and two processes on it corrupt it. `pnpm build` orders them for you.

- **The api worker's local D1 file lives at `apps/api/.wrangler/state/v3/d1/`.** Delete the folder to start over with an empty database.

- **Open the editor on `localhost`, not on the machine's LAN address.** Over plain `http` from any other address (`http://192.168.x.x:4002`, `http://<machine-name>:4002`) the browser is not in a secure context, withholds `crypto.randomUUID`, and the editor fails to load with "This page couldn't load". A known gap, not yet fixed: the editor calls `crypto.randomUUID` directly in about 75 places. Testing from a phone or a second laptop needs https (a tunnel, or a dev certificate) until it is.
