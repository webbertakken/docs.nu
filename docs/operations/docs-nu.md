# docs.nu deployment

LiveDoc runs at [docs.nu](https://docs.nu) on its own Cloudflare account. The top-level `wrangler.toml` of every app is docs.nu's production; nothing points at livediagram's infrastructure ([docs.nu vision, PR #1](https://github.com/webbertakken/livedoc/pull/1)). The general steps are in [Self-hosting](./self-hosting.md); this page records only what is specific to docs.nu.

## Shape

- Workers: `docs-nu-api`, `docs-nu-marketing`, `docs-nu-live`, `docs-nu-telemetry`, `docs-nu-help`, `docs-nu-router` and `docs-nu-mcp` (production deploys it: `deploy_mcp: true`). `mcp.docs.nu` is attached to `docs-nu-mcp` as a custom domain in the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers → docs-nu-mcp → Domains & Routes), not by the deploy.
- Resources: D1 `docs-nu`, R2 `docs-nu-images` and `docs-nu-bug-screenshots` (western Europe), and the KV namespace `docs-nu-mcp-oauth` for the MCP worker.
- Rate limiters use namespace ids `7001`-`7018`: the ids are account-wide, and other workers on the account hold `1001` onwards.
- Hostnames: `docs.nu` is canonical. `www.docs.nu` is attached to the router too, and a zone redirect rule (301, path and query kept) sends it to the apex. The zone has Always Use HTTPS on. Both zone settings live in the dashboard, not in this repo.
- Hosted profile (`apps/api/hosted-vars.json`, applied only in `webbertakken/livedoc`): telemetry on, image gallery caps of 100 images and 100 MB per owner, `APP_BASE_URL` `https://docs.nu`. No Google client id yet, so the Drive mirror is off.
- Sign-in is on (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, Google and email codes); its codes are sent as `LiveDoc <hello@docs.nu>`. AI is off until its key is set.
- No staging environment: every pull request gets its own preview at `https://<branch>.preview.docs.nu` ([Preview deployments](../specs/016-platform/preview-deployments.md)).

## Brand

docs.nu is LiveDoc's, and a guard keeps it so: `apps/help/lib/brand-name-guard.test.ts` fails on the old product name outside the pages about the [upstream project](../specs/002-project-scope/livediagram-upstream.md) and a few stored hash domains that must not change.

- Emails show the mark from `/email/livedoc-mark-64.png`, served by the marketing app. Every email ever sent points at that path, so it never moves.
- Documents are `.livedoc` files, `application/vnd.livedoc+json`; browser storage keys start `livedoc:`.
- The MCP registry listing (`server.json`, `io.github.webbertakken/livedoc`) is published by hand from **Actions > Publish MCP server to registry**, once `mcp.docs.nu` serves. Restore the workflow's push trigger then.

## Contact form

The contact form ([help pages](../specs/018-help/help-pages.md#the-contact-form)) is a LiveDoc form in a document owned
by Webber's docs.nu account, built and published with the CLI (`livedoc form add`, `livedoc form share … publish`).
Its responses are cards on that document's board, and its owner is emailed for each one. Publishing again makes a new
link, so a republished form means a new `CONTACT_FORM_URL`.

## Bug Tracker

Report a Bug ([spec](../specs/016-platform/bug-reports.md)) files every report as a card on the **Bug Tracker**, a
private document in Webber's docs.nu account, never shared. Until it is set up, reports are kept in D1 `bug_reports`
(reason `unconfigured`) and filed by the scheduled refile once it is.

What the hosted setup holds:

- **The document**: "Bug Tracker", owned by Webber's account, unshared. A board tab with one board whose columns are
  Reported, Triaged, In Progress, Fixed and Won't Fix (the last two done), in that order: reports land in the first.
- **The card type** "Bug Report" (the board takes it), with the custom fields Severity (Choice: Low, Medium, High,
  Critical), Context (Long Text), Screenshot (Link), Reporter (Text) and Release (Text). A field left out is written
  into the card's Details instead.
- **The vars** `BUG_REPORT_DOCUMENT_ID` (the document's id) and `BUG_REPORT_TAB_ID` (the board tab's id), in the
  production environment of `apps/api/hosted-vars.json`. Ids, not secrets.
- **The R2 bucket** `docs-nu-bug-screenshots` (binding `BUG_SCREENSHOTS`), western Europe, with a lifecycle rule
  `expire-bug-screenshots` deleting objects 90 days after upload. Create it before the first deploy that binds it.
- **The rate limiter** `BUG_REPORT_RATE_LIMITER`, namespace `7018`, needs nothing created.

Setting it up, once (the CLI steps were run against a local stack and file as described):

1. `wrangler r2 bucket create docs-nu-bug-screenshots --location weur`
2. `wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle add docs-nu-bug-screenshots expire-bug-screenshots --expire-days 90`
3. With the CLI signed in as Webber on docs.nu, write `types.json`:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "op": "add",
       "name": "Bug Report",
       "glyph": "bug",
       "color": "#dc2626",
       "fields": ["Description", "Assignee", "Priority"],
       "custom": [
         { "name": "Severity", "kind": "choice", "options": ["Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"] },
         { "name": "Context", "kind": "longtext" },
         { "name": "Screenshot", "kind": "link" },
         { "name": "Reporter", "kind": "text" },
         { "name": "Release", "kind": "text" }
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

   then run:

   ```sh
   livedoc document create "Bug Tracker" --tab Notes
   livedoc tab add "Bug Tracker" "Bug Reports" --template kanban
   livedoc type apply "Bug Tracker" -f types.json
   livedoc board set "Bug Tracker" Kanban --title "Bug Reports" \
     --columns "Reported,Triaged,In Progress,Fixed,Won't Fix" --types "Bug Report" --done "Fixed,Won't Fix"
   livedoc tab ls "Bug Tracker" --json
   ```

   The board must be on a **Board tab** (`tab add --template kanban` makes one): the api files only on a Board tab, and
   stores every report as `board_missing` otherwise. Note the document id and the "Bug Reports" tab id.

4. Set both ids in `apps/api/hosted-vars.json` (`environments.production`), merge and deploy.
5. Send a test report as a guest with a screenshot; check the card is on the board, the screenshot opens for Webber
   only (`/report-a-bug/screenshot?key=…`), then delete the test card.

Stored reports are read with `wrangler d1 execute docs-nu --remote --command "SELECT id, reason, attempts, created_at
FROM bug_reports"`; the refile files them every 15 minutes once the board takes them.

## Deploy

From a clean checkout of the commit to ship:

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=... scripts/deploy-docs-nu.sh
```

The script mirrors `deploy-reusable.yml`: it builds with the hosted profile's build-time twins, applies D1 migrations, deploys the api with the hosted vars and verifies them on the live worker, then deploys the five downstream apps and the router. `pnpm deploy:check` dry-runs the configs that carry bindings.

The first deploy of a brand-new worker can fail with `This Worker does not exist on your account. [code: 10007]`: wrangler reads the worker's workers.dev state a moment after creating it, before Cloudflare shows it. Run the script again after a minute or two; a worker that exists never hits this.

The token needs, on the account: Workers Scripts, D1, Workers R2 Storage and Workers KV Storage edit, plus Account Settings read. On the `docs.nu` zone: DNS and Workers Routes edit, for the custom domains.

## Moving content into rooms

The release that moves every document's content from D1 into its room ([Moving content into rooms](../specs/006-document/document-storage-move.md)) is Webber's to deploy. Each step below names who runs it; every command that writes is his.

### Before the deploy

1. From `apps/api`, take the plan (read-only: the tool runs only `SELECT`s, through wrangler) and keep its output and file:

   ```sh
   node --import ../../scripts/ts-source-hooks.mjs scripts/content-move.ts plan --remote --out content-move-plan.json
   ```

   It prints each document's id, tab count, content bytes and content hash.

### What the deploy does

`scripts/deploy-docs-nu.sh` applies D1 migrations `0105` to `0111` before the api deploys (the content summary column, the Inbox and image indexes keyed by document, `inbox_cards`, `document_images`, `room_purges`, the form link columns and `content_moves`); `0106` rebuilds `collab_actions` and `collab_threads` empty, and each room's first drain after its move refills them. Then:

- The every-minute cron moves up to 25 documents a run, 6 at once, never-tried first; a document whose move failed or mismatched is tried again an hour later. So N documents take about N / 25 minutes.
- A document opened before its turn moves on that request; while its move fails it answers 503 `content_moving` and the next request tries again. Documents created after the deploy are born moved.
- A move reads D1 and writes only the room and its `content_moves` record; D1's content tables stay as they were.
- Watch it with `pnpm exec wrangler tail docs-nu-api` (from `apps/api`): `[content-move] moved`, `failed` and `mismatch` lines, and `[content-move] sweep` per run. Progress, read-only:

  ```sh
  pnpm exec wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --command "SELECT COALESCE(m.status, 'unmoved') AS status, COUNT(*) AS n FROM documents d LEFT JOIN content_moves m ON m.document_id = d.id GROUP BY 1"
  ```

### After the deploy

Once every document reads `moved`, verify against the plan (read-only):

```sh
node --import ../../scripts/ts-source-hooks.mjs scripts/content-move.ts verify --remote --plan content-move-plan.json
```

It passes (exit 0) when every document is moved, every hash matches the plan and both sides of every record agree; it exits 1 and lists every document that does not. The release that drops D1's content tables waits for this to pass on docs.nu.

### Rollback

- Before the deploy: nothing has moved; nothing to undo.
- After it: the previous `docs-nu-api` version can be restored (`pnpm exec wrangler rollback` from `apps/api`, or the dashboard's Deployments). It reads D1's content tables, which the move never wrote, so every document shows its content as it was when it moved. Edits made in rooms since are not in D1 and are lost unless copied back first. Documents created since live only in their rooms and read as empty.
- Before restoring it, put the Inbox index back in the shape the previous version writes, or its tab saves with a comment or an action fail. Migration `0106` rebuilt it; this restores the old tables empty and lets the previous version seed them again on each owner's next read:

  ```sql
  DROP TABLE collab_actions;
  DROP TABLE collab_threads;
  CREATE TABLE collab_actions (tab_id TEXT NOT NULL, element_id TEXT NOT NULL, action_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    element_label TEXT NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL, description TEXT NOT NULL, status TEXT NOT NULL,
    assignee_user_id TEXT, assignee_member_id TEXT, assignee_name TEXT, assigner_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    assigner_name TEXT, team_id TEXT, created_at INTEGER NOT NULL, updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (tab_id, element_id, action_id), FOREIGN KEY (tab_id) REFERENCES tabs (id) ON DELETE CASCADE);
  CREATE INDEX collab_actions_assignee_idx ON collab_actions (assignee_user_id, status);
  CREATE INDEX collab_actions_assigner_idx ON collab_actions (assigner_id, status);
  CREATE INDEX collab_actions_member_idx ON collab_actions (assignee_member_id);
  CREATE TABLE collab_threads (tab_id TEXT NOT NULL, element_id TEXT NOT NULL, element_label TEXT NOT NULL,
    resolved INTEGER NOT NULL, comment_count INTEGER NOT NULL, participant_ids TEXT NOT NULL,
    latest_text TEXT NOT NULL, latest_author_name TEXT NOT NULL, latest_author_color TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_at INTEGER NOT NULL, latest_at INTEGER NOT NULL, mentioned_ids TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
    PRIMARY KEY (tab_id, element_id), FOREIGN KEY (tab_id) REFERENCES tabs (id) ON DELETE CASCADE);
  CREATE INDEX collab_threads_open_idx ON collab_threads (resolved, latest_at);
  DELETE FROM collab_index_state;
  ```

  The other new migrations only add tables and columns the previous version never reads, and its daily cron ignores the every-minute one.

- The class change's release (the room becoming a SQLite Durable Object) cannot be rolled back: Cloudflare refuses a rollback across a Durable Object migration. A fault there is fixed forward.

### Exporting D1

`wrangler d1 export` refuses a database with a virtual table, and `content_search_fts` (content search's index, migration `0104`) is one. To export, drop it and its triggers, export, then recreate them exactly as `apps/api/migrations/0104_content_search.sql` does and rebuild the index from `content_search`:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER content_search_ai;
DROP TRIGGER content_search_ad;
DROP TRIGGER content_search_au;
DROP TABLE content_search_fts;
-- export, then recreate the table and the three triggers from 0104, and:
INSERT INTO content_search_fts (content_search_fts) VALUES ('rebuild');
```

Content search finds nothing between the drop and the rebuild. D1 Time Travel restores the database to any minute of the last 30 days without an export.

## npm

LiveDoc publishes to npm under its own scope, `@livedoc`, an npm organisation owned by Webber's npm account. Its CLI is `@livedoc/cli`, the command `livedoc`. It never publishes under livediagram's names: upstream owns `@livediagram/cli`.

- Why `@livedoc`: the `livedocs` scope belongs to an unrelated npm user account, and the unscoped `livedocs` and `livedoc` packages belong to other people.
- Publishing goes through npm trusted publishing (OIDC) from `.github/workflows/cli-publish.yml`, with provenance. No npm token is stored anywhere.
- The workflow runs on every push to `main` that changes `apps/cli/package.json`, and by hand. It publishes the version in that file unless npm already has it, so a version bump is a release.
- The CLI's default host is `https://docs.nu`. Browser login (`livedoc auth login`, or `--device` for a code entered elsewhere) goes through the MCP worker's OAuth server at `https://mcp.docs.nu`, which the api names in `/api/capabilities` (`OAUTH_ISSUER`, a hosted var). An API token made in the Settings dialog still works (`livedoc auth login --with-token`). Its local commands (`guide`, `skill install`, `graph lint`, offline views of pulled files, `--help`) need no sign-in.

### Trusted publisher rules

These come from npm's [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) and [staged publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing) docs and `npm help trust`:

- A trusted publisher belongs to a package that already exists on npm. A name that has never been published has no settings page to add one to, and `npm trust` refuses it.
- A new trusted publisher must complete a successful publish within 2 days, or it expires and must be deleted and created again.
- Publishers created since 3 September 2026 allow only `npm stage publish` by default. `cli-publish.yml` runs `npm publish`, so **npm publish** must be ticked under allowed actions.
- The fields are case-sensitive and fixed once created; to change one, delete the publisher and add it again. Renaming `cli-publish.yml` or the repository breaks it.
- Trusted publishing needs npm 11.5 or later (the workflow updates npm itself) and GitHub-hosted runners, with `id-token: write` on the job.
- Provenance checks that the published `package.json`'s `repository.url` is this repository, `https://github.com/webbertakken/livedoc`; `apps/cli/scripts/build.mjs` writes it.

### Set up the package

1. Create the organisation: at [npmjs.com/org/create](https://www.npmjs.com/org/create), with two-factor authentication on the account, name it `livedoc` on the free plan (public packages only). [npmjs.com/org/livedoc](https://www.npmjs.com/org/livedoc) then shows it.
2. Create the package with a placeholder, by hand from Webber's machine (`npm login` first): `@livedoc/cli@0.0.0`. The CLI's real releases start above it.
3. On [npmjs.com/package/@livedoc/cli/access](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livedoc/cli/access), under **Trusted publisher**, choose **GitHub Actions**: organization or user `webbertakken`, repository `livedoc`, workflow filename `cli-publish.yml`, environment name empty, allowed actions **npm publish**. From the command line, with npm 11.15 or later: `npm trust github @livedoc/cli --repo webbertakken/livedoc --file cli-publish.yml --allow-publish`.
4. Within 2 days, merge a version bump of `apps/cli/package.json` to `main`, or run **Actions > CLI publish > Run workflow**. Its first successful publish validates the publisher.
5. Then, on the same page, set **Publishing access** to **Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens**.
