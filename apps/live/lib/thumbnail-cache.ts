// and the next mount went back to the network (at best the browser's HTTP
// cache) and re-decoded it, showing the loader in between. Keyed by the
// same inputs the thumbnail fetches for (viewer, document, version, share
// code, appearance), so an edited document's new `savedAt` is a new key and never
// reads the old picture, and a switch of appearance asks for the other half.
//
// A "no snapshot" answer is cached too: it is version-keyed like the
// picture, so it cannot change until the document does. A thrown fetch
// (network error) is not, so the next mount retries it.
