// Two things every page that talks to the api needs to do once the session is known
// (docs/specs/014-identity/auth-and-guest-access.md "Guest → account upgrade"):
//
//   1. Register the session token getter as the api-client's token provider, so every request carries
//      `Authorization: Bearer <session token>` instead of the guest header. Cleared on sign-out / unmount so the
//      guest path resumes cleanly.
//
//   2. Run the guest → account migration the first time the person is signed in AND a guest id is still in
//      `localStorage`: `POST /api/migrate` moves every guest-holdable row from the guest id to the account id. On
//      success the guest id is forgotten, so later loads skip the call. `authLoaded` stays false until the migration
//      settles, so no page reads owner data as the account while it still belongs to the guest id (issue #67).
//      lib/guest-migration.ts runs it once per page load.
//
// Returns the auth fields callers need, so there is exactly one place they come from per page.

  //
  // A LAYOUT effect on purpose. React runs a child's passive effects before
  // its parent's, and the render that flips `isSignedIn` is the same one that
  // hands children the account id as their owner (the Explorer's
  // CustomThemeProvider, say). With a plain useEffect, that child's first
  // fetch went out before the provider existed, so apiHeaders fell back to
  // `X-Owner-Id: <account id>`, which the worker refuses with a 401 (an account id
  // is never a guest credential). Every layout effect runs before any
  // passive one, so the provider is in place by the time a child fetches.
  //
  // Registered, not set: the page, AuthControls and the Settings rows each
  // mount this hook, and one of them unmounting must leave the others'
  // Bearer in place (see registerTokenProvider).
