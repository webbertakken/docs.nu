// (docs/specs/009-elements/images.md, "Placement grants").

// pasted into an unrelated document must not keep the bytes reachable after its
// reader loses access to the original. A document serves image X when X's
// owner owns the document, or the document holds a grant for X. Grants are
// written only at trusted moments: when the document's room pushes the images it
// places while X's owner is tied to the document (document-room/document-outbox.ts),
// and when a copy carries an image its source could serve. Until that push lands,
// an owner who is tied to the document right now is served as if granted.
